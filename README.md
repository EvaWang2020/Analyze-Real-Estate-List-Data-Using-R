This expo demonstrates how to use R to analyze real-life data. Some columns of the dataset have empty values,  and some have infinity values. They are often the biggest challenges in data analytics. The repo shows how to use the filter or ignore function to address them. Correlation analysis is common in data analytics. This expo introduces the correlation matrix to analyze the correlation of mutiple variables in one batch.

Repo docuements:
- RealEsateListAnalysis.ipynb
  - A Juypter file including the analysis using R
- Risk of average and generalization.pdf
  - A short article about the risk of average and risk of generalization in statistics
