This expo demonstrates how to use R to analyze real estate data, which was collected by myself. To see how I scraped the data and implemented the ETL, you can refer to this repo (https://github.com/EvaWang2020/Real-Estate-List-Scrape-Clean-Transform-Load). 
Some columns of the dataset have empty values,  and some have infinity values. They are often the biggest challenges in data analytics. The repo shows how to use the filter or ignore function to address them. Correlation analysis is common in data analytics. This expo introduces the correlation matrix to analyze the correlation of multiple variables in one batch.
