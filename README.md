This expo showcases the utilization of R for analyzing real estate data, meticulously collected by the author. For insights into the data scraping and ETL implementation process, refer to the corresponding repository (https://github.com/EvaWang2020/Real-Estate-List-Scrape-Clean-Transform-Load).

The dataset under analysis presents common yet significant challenges in data analytics, including null and infinite values. The repository adopts techniques such as filtering or ignoring functions to address these challenges.

Correlation analysis is a fundamental aspect of data analytics. This expo also introduces the correlation matrix as a tool to analyze the relationships between multiple variables concurrently.

Repository documents include:

1) RealEsateListAnalysis.ipynb:  It is a Jupyternotebook containing R-based analysis.
2) Risk of Average and Generalization.pdf: It is a short article discussing the statistical risks associated with averages and generalizations.
